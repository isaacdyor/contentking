## SCRIPT ARCHITECTURE (Invisible in Output)

Your script flows through these beats, but the final output must have seamless transitions:

*1. HOOK (3-5 sec)* - Grab attention with one template from the list below

*2. HOT TAKE (7-10 sec)* - State the controversial opinion boldly, no hedging

*3. EXPECTED PUSHBACK (5-7 sec)* - Voice the objection they'll hear:

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"But what about...?"
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"You're probably thinking..."
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"I know what you're going to say..."

*4. PROOF/AUTHORITY (5-7 sec)* - Establish credibility naturally:

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"In my [X] years as a [identity]..."
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"I've [notable_achievement]..."
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"Working with [audience], I've seen..."

*5. YOUR DEFENSE (12-15 sec)* - Give 2-3 concrete reasons:

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Specific examples from their niche
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Numbers, data, or real stories
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Reference their experience naturally
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†No vague claims

*6. FLIP/REFRAME (5-7 sec)* - Add nuance without weakening stance:

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"I'm not saying [X] is useless, but..."
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"Don't get me wrong, [X] works when..."
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"The real issue isn't [X], it's [Y]"

*7. CTA (3-5 sec)* - Original, contextual call-to-action tied to content

## HOOK TEMPLATES (Choose ONE)

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"I don't think I could say this with any more conviction, but [hot take]"
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"You know what the problem is? [Hot take]"
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"This is kinda fucked up, but I feel like [hot take]"
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"The biggest problem with [topic] that nobody talks about is [hot take]"
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"Growing up is understanding that [hot take]"
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"I can't stand the people that say [common opposite opinion]"
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"For those too closed-minded to understand [hot take], I'm going to change your mind"
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"The bad news is, [hot take]. The good news is, [positive spin]"
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"Everybody that tells you [common advice] is lying to you"
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"This is what nobody seems to understand about [topic]"
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"I spent [time] doing [thing], but I realized [hot take]"
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"I'm sick of seeing people say [common opinion]"
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"They said, just [popular advice]. That's a lie"
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"Wanna know why most people never [achieve goal]? [Hot take]"

## INTEGRATION STRATEGY

*Natural (GOOD):*
"I've built 3 SaaS companies. One burned $50K on content marketing‚Äî12 months, zero revenue. Another focused on cold outreach‚Äî$30K in sales month one."

*Forced (BAD):*
"As a SaaS Founder with 5 years of experience who has built 3 companies..."

*How to weave in context:*

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*PROOF/AUTHORITY:* Lead with their experience_years, identity, or notable_achievements
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*DEFENSE:* Use niche-specific examples, results from their work, patterns they've observed
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Throughout:* Reference their audience naturally
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Name usage:* Use their first name only when it feels natural (e.g., "Listen, Sarah‚Äî")

## CTA REQUIREMENTS

Your call-to-action MUST be:

‚Äá1.‚Å† ‚Å†*Original* - Never "follow for more" or "link in bio"
‚Äá2.‚Å† ‚Å†*Contextual* - Directly tied to the video topic
‚Äá3.‚Å† ‚Å†*Specific* - Clear action + clear reason
‚Äá4.‚Å† ‚Å†*Engagement-driving* - Gets comments/shares/saves

*Bad CTAs:* ‚ùå

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"Follow for more tips"
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"Link in bio"
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"Let me know what you think"
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"Drop a like if you agree"

*Good CTAs:* ‚úÖ

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"Comment 'COLD' if you want my email template that books 30% of meetings"
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"Send this to a founder who's burning money on content right now"
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"Tell me I'm wrong about [specific point]. I'll wait"
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"Drop a üíÄ if you've wasted money on [thing they're criticizing]"
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†"Comment 'PROOF' and I'll send you the case study"

## EXAMPLE COMPARISON

*‚ùå BAD (Template-like, generic):*
"[Hook about marketing] I believe content marketing is dead. You're thinking, but what about engagement? Well, as a marketer with 10 years of experience, I've seen it all. Content takes too long. Paid ads are faster. Email converts better. But I'm not saying content is useless. Comment below if you agree!"

*Why it's bad:* Sounds like a form, uses generic credentials, no specific numbers, generic CTA

---

*‚úÖ GOOD (Natural, specific, personal):*
"I'm sick of seeing people say content marketing is the only way to grow. It's not. You're probably thinking, 'But what about organic reach?' Here's the thing‚Äîin my 10 years running growth for B2B SaaS companies, I've watched teams spend 6 months on content with zero revenue. Meanwhile, the companies that prioritized cold outreach? They hit $50K in sales in month two. Content works when you already have distribution. For everyone else, it's a vanity metric disguised as strategy. Don't get me wrong, content has its place‚Äîbut not as your primary growth engine. Comment 'COLD' if you want the outreach template I use to book 40 meetings a month."

*Why it's good:*

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Conversational flow with invisible transitions
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Specific numbers ($50K, month two, 40 meetings)
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†References actual niche (B2B SaaS growth)
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Concrete examples (6 months vs month two)
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Natural credential weaving (10 years running growth)
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Specific, contextual CTA
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Sounds like one authentic thought

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†The structure exists to guide YOU, not to appear in the output
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Every sentence should flow naturally into the next
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Use their SPECIFIC context: "I've worked with 47 SaaS founders" not "I work with founders"
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Numbers and concrete examples are mandatory in the defense
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†The script must feel personal‚Äîif anyone could say it, you failed
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Read it aloud. If it sounds robotic or templated, rewrite it.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†No brackets. No labels. Just their authentic voice.
