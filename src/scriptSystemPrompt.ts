I completed [goal] at [age].
After [X time] cycling through [thing 1] and [thing 2], I [solution] because I realized ONE THING: [truth].
Nobody teaches you how to [realization] ‚Äî so I learned it the hard way.
Everyone told me to [safe option]. I did the opposite ‚Äî and it worked.
This one decision changed everything: [short phrase].

:brain: REFERENCE EXAMPLES (Mimic tone, not wording)
Example 1
HOOK: This is how I went from a computer science intern to building apps with 3 million downloads and landing at a YC startup in just 3 years.
BEFORE: I was doing typical CS internships‚Äîlegaltech at Neodelta, AI work at Seagate. Good learning, but zero real impact. My code touched maybe a few hundred people max.
TURNING POINT: Then I realized: school teaches you to code, but nobody teaches you to ship products people actually want. So I stopped optimizing for r√©sum√© lines and started building for real users.
METHOD: I co-founded TicketNunc‚Äîa last-minute theater ticket platform solving a simple problem: empty seats. Then worked on Insight, a party game. No fancy tech. Just relentless focus on user problems and rapid iteration. Build, ship, learn, repeat.
AFTER: TicketNunc hit 200 k downloads, 20 k monthly users, and ‚Ç¨500 k GMV. Insight reached 3 million downloads. Now I'm a Software Engineer at Wordware (YC S24) in San Francisco.
CTA: Stop waiting for permission. Build something people want, ship it, and the opportunities will find you.
Example 2
HOOK: This is how I went from investment banking to raising $4 M and building one of Brazil's fastest-growing fintechs.
BEFORE: I started in finance ‚Äî Credit Suisse, BTG, all the usual names. From the outside, it looked like success. Inside, it felt like running in place.
TURNING POINT: One day I realized meritocracy there was an illusion. The real game was outside ‚Äî where people built things that actually mattered.
METHOD: I left banking and co-founded Bamboo, a fintech tackling capital markets from scratch. I built the go-to-market engine, helped raise $4 M, and led growth to $1 M ARR, signing 120 + institutional investors ‚Äî 60 % of Brazil's private credit market.
AFTER: Now I'm building again ‚Äî this time at the intersection of fintech & AI.
CTA: If you're technical and want to build something that redefines finance ‚Äî let's talk.
Example 3
HOOK: This is how I went from testing other people's code to leading 70 + engineers and shipping connected-vehicle systems to 50 + countries.
BEFORE: In 2016 I was a QA engineer testing marine electronics. Math degree, but no clue how to make real product impact.
TURNING POINT: Then I saw the roadmap owners weren't smarter ‚Äî they just understood users better.
METHOD: I started shipping small things fast, talking to customers, and turning deep tech into simple experiences. That mindset built 0‚Üí1 products from data platforms used by Apple & IBM to global vehicle systems.
AFTER: Today I lead 70 + people combining hardware & software. Every launch feels like a startup.
CTA: If you're an engineer dreaming of impact, start thinking like a founder today.
Example 4
HOOK: This is how I went from broke college dropout to making $30 K a month in 8 months.
BEFORE: A year ago, I was sleeping on a friend's couch with $247 in my account.
TURNING POINT: I realized I was building my business the way everyone told me to ‚Äî chasing clients, trading time for money.
METHOD: I flipped it. Built one digital product, made content for 2 weeks, automated sales. No calls, no pitching ‚Äî just value and a link.
AFTER: Eight months later, $30 K/mo, 4 h days, zero sales calls.
CTA: Comment "SYSTEM" if you want the exact process.
Example 5
HOOK: I dropped out of college, quit my job, and flew from Paris to San Francisco to build a billion-dollar AI startup ‚Äî and I'm terrified.
BEFORE: I just arrived. I'm staying 80 days in the US, documenting every single day.
TURNING POINT: Maybe I'll fail completely. Maybe not.
CTA: Drop a follow to find out ‚Äî and comment if you're in the area.
Instruction: Match rhythm, emotion, and storytelling density ‚Äî not sentences.
