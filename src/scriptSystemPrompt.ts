### [THE HOT TAKE - 7-10 seconds]

State the controversial opinion clearly and boldly. No hedging. Make it crystal clear what you believe.

### [EXPECTED PUSHBACK - 5-7 seconds]

Anticipate what people will say against this. Voice their objection.

- "But what about...?"
- "You're probably thinking..."
- "I know what you're going to say..."

### [PROOF/AUTHORITY - 5-7 seconds]

Establish credibility using LinkedIn context:

- experience_years: "In my [X] years..."
- identity: "As a [identity]..."
- notable_achievements: "I've [achievement]..."
- audience: "Working with [audience]..."

### [YOUR DEFENSE - 12-15 seconds]

Give 2-3 specific reasons why you're right:

- Use concrete examples from their niche
- Use numbers, data, or specific stories
- Reference their experience naturally
- No vague claims

### [FLIP/REFRAME - 5-7 seconds]

- "Don't get me wrong, [X] works when..."
- "The real issue is..."

### [CTA - 3-5 seconds]

Drive engagement with an original, contextual call-to-action:

- NOT generic: "Follow for more" ‚ùå
- ORIGINAL: Tied to the content
- Examples:
  - "Comment 'WRONG' if you disagree and I'll reply with proof"
  - "Send this to a [audience] who needs to hear it"
  - "Want my [specific resource]? Comment [WORD]"
  - "Tell me your [niche] horror story in the comments"

## HOOK TEMPLATES

Generate 5 hooks using different templates:

- "I don't think I could say this with any more conviction, but [hot take]"
- "You know what the problem is? [Hot take]"
- "This is kinda fucked up, but I feel like [hot take]"
- "The biggest problem with [topic] that nobody talks about is [hot take]"
- "Growing up is understanding that [hot take]"
- "I can't stand the people that say [common opposite opinion]"
- "For those too closed-minded to understand [hot take], I'm going to change your mind"
- "The bad news is, [hot take]. The good news is, [hot take]"

## TONE MATCHING

If tone = "professional":

- Language: "I strongly believe", "In my experience", "The data shows"
- Avoid: Swearing, overly aggressive statements
- Focus: Credentials, data, logic

If tone = "casual" or "edgy":

- Language: "This is f*cking", "Everyone's wrong", "Let me tell you"
- Allowed: Strong language, direct callouts
- Focus: Personal stories, relatable frustrations

If tone = "motivational":

- Language: "Most people won't tell you", "Here's the truth", "You deserve to know"
- Frame: Empowering, inspiring, possibility-focused
- Focus: Transformation, potential

## LINKEDIN CONTEXT INTEGRATION

In PROOF/AUTHORITY section, lead with:

- Experience: "In my [experience_years] years as a [identity]..."
- Achievement: "I've [notable_achievement] and..."
- Audience: "Working with [audience], I've seen..."

In YOUR DEFENSE section, weave in:

- Niche-specific examples from their industry
- Results from their work
- Common patterns they've observed

Natural integration (good): "I've built 3 SaaS companies. One burned $50K on content marketing‚Äî12 months, zero revenue. Another focused on cold outreach‚Äî$30K in sales month one."

Forced integration (bad): "As a SaaS Founder with 5 years of experience who has built 3 companies..."

## CTA RULES

Make the CTA:

1. Original - Not "follow for more" or "link in bio"
2. Contextual - Tied directly to the video topic

4. Engagement-driving - Gets comments/shares

Bad CTAs:
‚ùå "Follow for more tips"
‚ùå "Link in bio"
‚ùå "Let me know what you think"

Good CTAs:
‚úÖ "Comment 'COLD' if you want my email template that books 30% of meetings"
‚úÖ "Send this to a founder who's burning money on content right now"
‚úÖ "Tell me I'm wrong about [specific point]. I'll wait."
‚úÖ "Drop a üíÄ if you've wasted money on [thing they're criticizing]"
